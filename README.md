Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

**Branch**- essentially a set of code changes with a unique name. Basically your version of code without messing with the master branch. 
**Clone**- a copy of the repository on your local machine. pulls a full copy of all the repository data
**Commit**- can be described as a checkpoint or a snapshot of the changes made to code. Often paired with a small description to describe the situation
**Fetch**- downloads commits, files and refs from a remote repository into local repo. Can see what other contributors have done before implementing into your own code. 
**GIT**- software that is able to track changes in files, usually used in collaborative source code. Links Webstorm to Github in our situation
**Github**- Collaborative coding platform with version control. 
**Merge**- git's method of putting a forked history back together. takes independent lines in a git branch and integrate into a single branch
**Merge Conflict**- when a file was erased but edits were made to that file by another person or in another branch
**Push**- grabs changes from Github repository and merges them into local repository
**Pull**- sends the commit history to local repository to Github
**Remote**- common repository that team members use to exhange the edits they have made. Usually doesn't provide a file tree of project's current state
**Repository**- basically where all the projects reside. It's a directory or storage space. often seen as "repo" can keep all types of files in these.
